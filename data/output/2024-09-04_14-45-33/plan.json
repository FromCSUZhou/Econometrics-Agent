AveOccup (Average Occupancy per Dwelling): The coefficient is -0.0366, which is significant (p-value < 0.0001). This negative relationship suggests that higher occupancy rates might be associated with lower house prices, possibly due to overcrowding or lower quality of living conditions.\n\n# 7. Latitude: The coefficient is -0.8966, which is highly significant (p-value < 0.0001). This indicates that houses located further north tend to be less expensive, which could be due to various regional economic factors.\n\n# 8.

This suggests that houses located further west tend to be less expensive, which could be due to regional economic factors or proximity to less desirable areas.\n\n# Overall, the model explains about 61.3% of the variance in house prices (R-squared = 0.613), which is a reasonable fit for this type of data.\n",

This negative relationship suggests that higher occupancy rates are associated with lower house prices, possibly due to overcrowding.\n#    - **Latitude**: The coefficient is -0.8966, which is highly significant (p-value < 0.000). This indicates that houses located further north tend to be less expensive.\n#    - **Longitude**: The coefficient is -0.8689, which is highly significant (p-value < 0.000). This indicates that houses located further west tend to be less expensive.\n\n# 3. **Economic Interpretation**:\n#    - The most economically significant variable is Median Income, which has a strong positive relationship with house prices. This aligns with economic theory, as higher income levels increase the ability to purchase more expensive homes.\n#    - The negative coefficients for Latitude and Longitude suggest that geographic location plays a crucial role in determining house prices, with certain areas being more desirable than others.\n#    - The significance of HouseAge and AveBedrms indicates that both the age and the number of bedrooms in a house are important factors in determining its price.\n\n# Overall, the regression model provides valuable insights into the factors that influence house prices in California. However, it is important to consider that the model explains only 61.3% of the variance, indicating that other factors not included in the model also play a significant role in determining house prices.\n",

This suggests that an increase in median income is strongly associated with an increase in house prices. Economically, this makes sense as higher income levels typically lead to higher purchasing power and demand for housing.\n#    - **HouseAge**: The coefficient is 0.1224, which is also highly significant (p-value < 0.000). This indicates that older houses tend to have higher prices, possibly due to their location in more established neighborhoods.\n#    - **AveRooms (Average Rooms per Dwelling)**: The coefficient is -0.3051, which is significant (p-value < 0.000). This negative relationship might seem counterintuitive, but it could be due to multicollinearity with other variables or the fact that larger houses might be located in less desirable areas.\n#    - **AveBedrms (Average Bedrooms per Dwelling)**: The coefficient is 0.3711, which is significant (p-value < 0.000). This positive relationship suggests that houses with more bedrooms tend to be more expensive.\n#    - **Population**: The coefficient is -0.0023, which is not significant (p-value = 0.699). This indicates that population density does not have a significant impact on house prices in this model.\n#    - **AveOccup (Average Occupancy per Household)**: The coefficient is -0.0366, which is significant (p-value < 0.000). This negative relationship suggests that higher occupancy rates are associated with lower house prices, possibly due to overcrowding.\n#    - **Latitude**: The coefficient is -0.8966, which is highly significant (p-value < 0.000). This indicates that houses located further north tend to be less expensive.\n#    - **Longitude**: The coefficient is -0.8689, which is highly significant (p-value < 0.000). This indicates that houses located further west tend to be less expensive.\n\n# 3. **Economic Interpretation**:\n#    - The most economically significant variable is Median Income, which has a strong positive relationship with house prices. This aligns with economic theory, as higher income levels increase the ability to purchase more expensive homes.\n#    - The negative coefficients for Latitude and Longitude suggest that geographic location plays a crucial role in determining house prices, with certain areas being more desirable than others.\n#    - The significance of HouseAge and AveBedrms indicates that both the age and the number of bedrooms in a house are important factors in determining its price.\n\n# Overall, the regression model provides valuable insights into the factors that influence house prices in California. However, it is important to consider that the model explains only 61.3% of the variance, indicating that other factors not included in the model also play a significant role in determining house prices.\n",
